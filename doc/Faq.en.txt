FAQ:

1. What does drbl-winRoll solve?
- 1.1 Support windows clients can accept commands from DRBL server
- 1.2 Solve windows hostname duplication problem for using clone tool to distribute  Win-OS in one local LAN. 
- 1.3 Auto rename Windows "Workgroup" name via netmask and network domain
- 1.4 Auto renew Windows SID

2. Which steps does drbl-winRoll installation do ?
The steps includes to install needed software and configure related registry in windows, the detail as the follow:
- 2.1 Automatic cygwin installation
- 2.2 Install hostname check service, workgroup name check service and set the local LAN as DHCP
- 2.3 Install Windows SID check service.
- 2.4 Setup sshd service and open a listening port 22 if need (For XP or later version)

3. How does drbl-winRoll implement ?
- 3.1 sshd service provide by cygwin 
- 3.2 MS Windows configuration: modify windows register , net , netsh , regedit ..etc command
- 3.3 Hostname check, workgroup name check : autohostname.sh, wsname.exe. Set as a service by cygwin and execute autohostname.sh to modify 
- 3.4 Sid check : autonewsid.sh ,newsid.exe. Set it as a service by cygwin and execute autonewsid.sh to renew sid 

4. How to Windows hostname be assigned by drbl-winRoll 
Default to use the last 6 numbers for IP and combine with prefix "PC" as its hostname, ex:
Its IP is 192.168.1.52, then its hostname would be : PC-001-052
Manager can follow the steps to change hostname format as you like:
몇Programs몈->몇Cygwin몈-> 몇drbl_winRoll-config몈메to edit  "winRoll.txt" , find the line멚
HN_WSNAME_PARAM = xxxx 

The guide is the follow:

# 	HN_WSNAME_PARAM = /N:PC-$MAC			PC-"Mac Address" 메ex멚PC-000C294EEF53
# 	HN_WSNAME_PARAM = /N:PC-$MAC[+8]		PC-"Mac Address the last 8  characters"메ex멚PC-000C294E
# 	HN_WSNAME_PARAM = /N:PC-$IP			PC-"IP address"메뵳멚 PC-192-168-001-052
# 	HN_WSNAME_PARAM = /N:PC-$IP[3+]		PC-" IP the first 3 characters"메ex멚 PC-192

Moreover, hostname can be assigned by local file, edit "HN_WSNAME_PARAM = xxxx " as the follow:
HN_WSNAME_PARAM = /RDF:C:\cygwin\drbl_winRoll-config\hosts.txt /DFK:$MAC
/RDF define the path of local file메/DFK define the field for searching key

A sample for hosts file: "IP or MAc Address" = "hostname" 메ex멚
000C294EEF53 = Student-01		(Assign "Student-01" as hostname if its MAC address is 000C294EEF53 )
192-168-001-012 = Student-02	(Assign "Student-02" as hostname if its IP address is 192.168.1.12 )

if use /DFK:$MAC 메it would be assigned as "Student-01"메/DFK:$IP it would be "Student-02"

By this way, Manager can define hostname freely , but we suggest to collect all of MAC address and write down in
the template machine. The other cloned machines would be assigned hostname by their own attribute 

PS멚drbl-winRoll use wsname tool to change hostname메so we supported format of hostname is full consistently with wsname tool.

5. How to assign Windows workgroup name ?
It can be assigned by three parameters
	-1. fix string , ex: WG
	-2. By IP/Netmask, ex: GROUP-$NM
		ip:192.168.20.2	NM:255.255.255.0 => Workgroup: GROUP-020
		ip:172.18.1.5	NM:255.255.0.0 => Workgroup: GROUP-018-001
	-3. By DNS suffix , ex :WG-$DNS_SUFFIX
		DNS Suffix Search List. . . . . . : my..org.domain  => WG-my-org
It use fix string "WG" as default parameters.

6. How to decide to re-assign Windows SID ? 
It would check the NIC mac address if the same with system logged before , if not, program would re-assign SID at run time.
For security reason, SID must be assigned randomly, and the recorded of mac address would be encode with md5sum.

7. Any steps need to do after install ?
If you want to your windows clients can accept the commands from DRBL server, please follow 
the step:
	-0. Switch to root, check if there're id_rsa, id_rsa.pub in /root/.ssh folder.If not, keep go no next step. If they exist, please jump to step 3 to install ssh key.

	-1. Create teh root's ssh keys (private and public key) , and press [Enter] during ask "passphrase " in this process.

	$ ssh-keygen
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	Enter same passphrase again:
	Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	fe:56:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:83:ff:42 root@drbl-client

	-2. It would create the root' ssh keys: id_rsa id_rsa.pub , as the follow:

	$  ls -al /root/.ssh
	$  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub

	-3. Transmit the file "id_rsa.pub" to the directory (c:\cygwin\home\administrator\.ssh) in windows and save the file as "authorized_keys"

	copy [path of id_rsa.pub] c:\cygwin\home\administrator\.ssh\authorized_keys


	-4. After all, you can send a command to clients from DRBL server, ex:

	$ ssh  administrator@[win-client-ip]  ipconfig

8. After clone my MS Windows clients, how can it change its serial number and Security key when it boot next time, even it re-configure its hardware by itself ?
Please MS Windows web page as the follow:
" How to use the Sysprep tool to automate successful deployment of Windows XP "
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;302577&sd=tech 
or 
http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb;zh-tw;302577

9. Is it necessary to use drbl-winRoll under DRBL environment ?
Not really. It would still need the service to provide NAT function to let Windows clients use Internet.
Of course, DRBL server provide NAT, DHCP function, and clients can be centralized managed .

10. Can drbl-winRoll be wored with other clone tool ?
Sure, it can work with any clone tool to solve the clone system issue , ex: Clonezilla멕Ghost멕Acronis True Image... tec.
drbl-winRoll has no any involvement with other software licence. The development of drbl-winRoll use GPL to release.
